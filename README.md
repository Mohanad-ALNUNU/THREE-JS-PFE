# THREE-JS-PFE

## ðŸŽ¤ MY WORDS ðŸŽ¤

this is one of my premiers projects in my development career, it have been developed for educational purposes (as a project of gradutating from second universal year)

I know it's very messy, not structured code (a code without any conventions or Good practice ðŸ˜†) and I think it's a good thing that I can see that now. It's a good indicator!
